# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description 

My motivation for this project was to further my learning in accessible web development. I wanted to improve my skills and understanding in HTML, CSS and the command line. I built this project to test my learning and to prove that whilst different code can create the same visual experience, it might have flaws underneath the surface which make it both inaccessible to certain users and to developers working to make improvements. The project should successfully solve the issue of inaccessibility in the previous edition and the code-base should be more readible to external developers. I learned a lot from this process about HTML semantics, the importance of image attributes and how to use them and I have already improved the speed and competence with which I can use VS Code and the command line.
